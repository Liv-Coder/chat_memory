# Real-world Examples

This document contains practical scenarios and code sketches to help you
adapt `chat_memory` in production systems.

## Customer Support Chatbot

Pattern: persist conversation vectors, retrieve similar resolved tickets, and
attach them to the prompt when agents or bots answer.

Sketch:

```dart
final manager = await EnhancedConversationManager.create(preset: MemoryPreset.production);
await manager.appendUserMessage('My app crashes on startup');
final prompt = await manager.buildPrompt(clientTokenBudget: 6000);
// Use prompt.promptText with LLM
```

## Educational AI Tutor

Pattern: summarize lesson sessions after completion and retrieve related
concepts for follow-up questions.

## Code Review Assistant

Pattern: index prior code snippets and review comments as vector entries; when
reviewing new PRs, retrieve similar patterns and suggestions.

## Content Creation Assistant

Pattern: store narrative elements as metadata-rich messages and retrieve
character/plot details semantically to maintain consistency.

## Multi-user Chat System

Pattern: use per-user namespaces for vector entries and an aggregated index for
shared knowledge. Isolate conversational state per-user for privacy.

## Voice Assistant Integration

Pattern: convert speech-to-text, append as messages, and use same memory APIs
to preserve context between voice sessions.
