# Chat Memory - Hybrid Memory Management System

A powerful Dart package that provides sophisticated memory management for conversational AI applications. Features include **summarization-based compression**, **semantic retrieval**, and **hybrid memory layers** for optimal context management.

## ‚ú® Features

### üß† Hybrid Memory Architecture

- **Short-term Rolling Memory**: Recent messages preserved for immediate context
- **Long-term Summaries**: Automatic compression of older conversations
- **Semantic Memory**: Vector-based retrieval of relevant historical context
- **Token Budget Management**: Intelligent context fitting within LLM limits

### üîÑ Summarization Strategies

- **Chunked Summarization**: Process messages in manageable chunks
- **Layered Summaries**: Create summaries of summaries to prevent information loss
- **Configurable Retention**: Control how much recent context to preserve
- **Multiple Summarizer Backends**: Pluggable summarization services

### üîç Semantic Search

- **Local Vector Storage**: SQLite-based embedding storage for persistence

## Quick Start

Install the package and run a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:chat_memory/chat_memory.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  final manager = await EnhancedConversationManager.create();
  await manager.appendSystemMessage('You are a helpful assistant.');
  await manager.appendUserMessage('Tell me about Dart futures.');
  final prompt = await manager.buildPrompt(clientTokenBudget: 4000);
  print(prompt.promptText);
}
```
